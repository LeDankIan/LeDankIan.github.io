      <h1>My Forest Park</h1>
      <h2>by Ian Pfeiffer</h2>
      <p>The land now known as Forest Park was once the home of Lenape and Delaware Native Americans, followed by settlers of the Dutch West India Company. In 1895, the area was designated as part of the City of Brooklyn; it now belongs to my home borough of Queens in New York City. What would the inhabitants of long ago make of the diverse population making use of the park today? What would they think of setting aside 538 acres for a green oasis in the midst of a densely populated area unlike any they had ever seen? Perhaps the only thing that early European settlers and the Native Americans who died of the diseases that they brought with them would relate to is our current pandemic, a modern plague which has made a place like Forest Park even more valuable. </p>
      <p>Much of my early childhood was spent in Forest Park. My earliest memories are of cautiously navigating a jungle gym along with the children of Russian, Polish, Asian, and Israeli immigrants. I learned to ride my bike by a discontinued line of Long Island Railroad tracks that passed through the park. It is easy to forget that the park is bordered by a turnpike and heavily trafficked streets. This is especially true for visitors who walk along the park’s closed roads or ride horses on its numerous bridle paths. The mom-and-pop stores and apartment buildings along Metropolitan Avenue in Kew Gardens, where I lived until I was four years old, are a stone’s throw from the playground that I visited daily. Yet, they seemed miles away while sprinting across a field or walking under a thick canopy of trees. </p>
      <p>Forest Park cuts through several Queens neighborhoods: Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill, Glendale, Woodhaven, and Forest Hills, which is where I live. Each neighborhood has its own character, reflecting the ethnic makeup of its residents; the mix of stores, restaurants, and homes; and the proximity to public transportation, among other things. What they all have in common is an urban suburban feel that to me, is one of the benefits of living in Queens. I live on 108th Street, north of Queens Boulevard: a succession of co-ops and rental buildings fronted by trees and landscaping to offset the concrete and brick. The streets behind my building are lined with private homes: faux villas and gaudy mansions with gold leaf-tipped iron gates, paved over lawns, and phallic shaped bushes. On these streets, it is possible to feel as if you are in the suburbs, but the illusion is often shattered by revved cars speeding by, trying to make it to the Grand Central Expressway in record time. Ambulances race at all hours to nearby Long Island Jewish Forest Hills Hospital and fire engines blare their way from Engine 324 in Corona. The noise seemed to reach a new level during the height of the pandemic, when every siren seemed to scream about its dangers: the closest thing to a plague in my lifetime. </p>
      <p>Quarantine left many throughout the city feeling isolated and trapped within their homes. For homebodies like me, the beginning of the pandemic was a kind of a free pass to stay on the couch all day. But over time, even I felt the need to venture outdoors. Forest Park beckoned. I was often accompanied by a friend on my walks there. Most of the people we passed were like us, walking in pairs: two by two, as if the park were an ark that could, if only for a little while, rescue us from rising worries over COVID-19. Forest Park became a haven for many, a safe space in which to walk, run, scoot, skate, bike or just be. Parents afraid to let their children play on swings and slides let them loose on grass and beds of pine needles. All around me people were moving, talking, and embracing the outdoors; wearing a mask seemed a small price to pay. Forest Park more than fulfilled the purpose for which it was intended: to serve as “an agrarian delight,” as the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation puts it, for its users. In a way, my 16-year-old-self reconnected with my younger selves. I realized that wherever I go, I need to strike a balance between the urban, suburban, and agrarian, although I am not exactly sure where or what that means yet. The Lenape, Dutch colonists, and those that followed could not have imagined the importance of such a place. The park’s natural beauty, openness, and relative quiet helped me and countless others through a difficult time which has not yet ended. I do know that wherever I go, I will take a piece of Forest Park with me.</p>
